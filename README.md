Supermarket Sales Data Analysis (Python Project)
This is a project focused on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing supermarket sales data using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Project Goals:
- Clean and inspect real-world sales data
- Identify high-performing regions and products
- Discover monthly trends in revenue
- Create visual insights for business decisions

Tools & Technologies:
Tool	          Purpose
Python	     Programming language
Pandas	     Data cleaning and manipulation
NumPy	       Numerical operations
Matplotlib	 Basic plotting
Seaborn	     Statistical visualizations

Analysis Performed:
- Data Cleaning:
Checked data types, missing values, duplicates
Removed any duplicate entries
Converted Date column to datetime
Created new column YearMonth for monthly grouping

- Visualizations & Insights:
Total Revenue by Region
→ Bar plot highlighting the top-performing regions by revenue

Monthly Revenue Trend
→ Line plot showing how revenue changes over time

Top 10 Products by Revenue
→ Bar plot of the highest revenue-generating products

Revenue Heatmap
→ Pivot heatmap showing product-region combinations by revenue

What I Learned:
- Real-world dataset cleaning
- How to group and aggregate data using groupby
- Creating visuals that drive business insights
- Improving storytelling with heatmaps and time series
